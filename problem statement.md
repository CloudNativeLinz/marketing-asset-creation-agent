

Scenario:
we are a conference or meetup organizer dealing with speaker management.

Problem statement:
- speaker profiles often incomplete
- speaker data is often unstructured and difficult to analyze
- speaker data not provided by the speakers in time
- speaker data often outdated

Solution:
- have an agent fetch the speaker details via various resources on the web such as LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, personal websites, etc.
- have an agent analyze the speaker data and extract relevant information to create a comprehensive speaker profile
- have an agent build a speaker profile based on the gathered information
- have an agent generate a speaker image based on the speaker profile and speaker characteristics (such as technologies used, interests, etc.)
